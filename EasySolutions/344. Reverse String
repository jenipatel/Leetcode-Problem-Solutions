Problem: Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of 
         characters char[].

         Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input
         array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

         You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Example: Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
         Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2: Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
           Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
